        <h1 style="color: rgb(25, 218, 218);">Company Policy</h1><br>

       <h1 style="font-size: 30px; color: yellow;">Workplace Health and Safety</h1><br>

       <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">The Workplace Health and Safety policy outlines the company’s commitment to ensuring a safe and hazard-free environment for its employees. It details preventative actions, emergency management, and additional measures to promote health and safety, emphasizing the importance of adhering to established guidelines and procedures.</p><br>

       <h1 style="font-size: 30px; color: yellow">Equal Opportunity Policy</h1><br>

       <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">Being an equal opportunity employer is mandated by law in most countries. This equal opportunity policy prohibits any company from discriminating against employees or job applicants on the basis of a “protected characteristic” (gender, age, race etc.). It is fundamental for non-discrimination, anti-harassment, workplace violence and diversity policies. It can also help your business for two reasons: first, it expands the pool of people from which to choose the best applicant for any job and secondly, it creates a fair environment for employees to co-exist, work and thrive in. Putting it in writing will send the message to everyone that equal opportunity is a reality at your company.</p><br>

       <h1 style="font-size: 30px; color: yellow;">Employee Disciplinary Action Policy</h1><br>

       <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">Occasionally problems will arise at work and dealing with them is much easier with a clear disciplinary policy in place. Employees must know how and under what circumstances they will be disciplined. A standardized step-by-step process will help you ensure fair and appropriate treatment, even if you don’t formally disclose the entire procedure. It will also show that you are an employer who does not tolerate serious violations but also values remedial actions in the case of minor offences. Take care though to consult a lawyer to ensure that the procedures you have in place are lawful.
